	    <p>Powerlifting is a competitive discipline that involves three main movements: squat, bench and deadlift. These three movements are complex, full body, movements that together test a full range of strength from the lifter. The squat and the deadlift use the lower body as the prime movers for the lift, and the bench focuses more on the upper body, but they all require full body and core support for stability and maximizing the power of the lift.</p>

		<p>The squat is performed with the barbell supported on the back of the lifter while they squat down until the upper crease of their hip joint is below the top of their knees and then stand up to full hip extension.</p>

		<p>The bench is performed with the lifter laying horizontally on their back on a bench. The barbell is held in their hands above them, lowered to their chest and then pressed back to full arm extension.</p>
