	    <p>Weightlifting, also commonly refered to as olympic weightlifting, is a competitive discipline that involves two main movements: the snatch, and the clean and jerk. These two movements are complex, full body, explosive movements that require not only strength, but also significant mobility in order to execute properly.</p>

		<p>The snatch is a barbell lift starting with the barbell on the ground in front of the lifter and ending with the barbell in the hands of the lifter above their head with arms, legs and hips fully extended. This transition is performed in one single movement from start to finish position.</p>

		<p>The clean and jerk is also a lift that starts with the barbell on the ground in front of the lifter and ends with the barbell in the hands of the lifter above there head with arms, legs and hips fully extended. However, this lift is broken up into two movements. The clean portion of the lift takes the barbell from the floor to resting on the chest and shoulders of the lifter in what is called the front rack position. From here the lifter performs the jerk portion of the lift to move the bar overhead into the final position.</p>
